Glad to see you here   :)  
I'm **diskukumber**, music cinema and tech lover  
I'm also a retro nerd and privacy geek.

You are probably wondering who or what the hell is **diskukumber**, well i will tell you the story of where 
this name came from.

![gif](/images/about/anicandle.gif)![gif](/images/about/book.gif)  
It all started 3000 years ago when...  
heh heh just kidding :)  
**diskukumber** comes from two words disguise and cucumber so the full name is disguise cucumber  
but for simplicity i short it to **diskukumber** and now is double meaning **diskukumber** as of this cucumber and the original disguise cucumber.  
cucumber being my childhood nickname and disguise for my obsession with privacy and conceal my identity
online and i replace the C with K in cucumber referencing to my real name.  
Also known as **Larry Needlemeyer**![image](/images/about/larryneedlemeyer.png)

## **Q - Top 3 Artists?**
![gif](/images/about/starmove.gif)I listen to a lot of artists, and I can easily name the top two, but for third place, there are a lot of artists fighting for that spot. You can follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31pdcgjio77p27txw5p74pc747ia?si=2a206b4b8e274698), and check out my playlist and find out more about my music activity there.

## **Q - What do you know about tech?**
![gif](/images/about/starmove.gif)I try to keep my knowledge in tech general and not limit myself to something specific, although I have deep knowledge of some technologies, but I always try to learn new things and innovate something or find better solutions and improve them. In other words tech savvy.
